Documentation
-------------

This documentation is partially inspired by the documentation of
the documentations of the Python packages `pyvisgen <https://github.com/radionets-project/pyvisgen>`_,
`astropy <https://github.com/astropy/astropy>`_.

While no substantial code segments were adapted, this documentation makes use of
packages and tools (e.g. ``automodapi`` or ``towncrier``) which are also used
in these projects.
Especially the page structure of the :ref:`api-reference`'s source code, is inspired by
the `pyvisgen <https://github.com/radionets-project/pyvisgen>`_ package.

All of their licenses are listed on our :ref:`license` page.
